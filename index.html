        Hi, I'm <strong>Campbell Baron</strong>. Welcome to my personal website.
        ðŸ‘‹
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4">
        I'm the Co-Founder and CEO of
        <a href="https://montra.com" target="_blank" style="color: #0000EE" class="underline"
          >Montra</a
        >,
        a slide based video creation tool that makes it easy to create
        professional videos.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4">
        Born in Toronto, Ontario, I got my start producing videos for the CBC
        (Canadian Broadcasting Corporation) when I was fourteen. A year later,
        inspired by the world of startups, I launched my own podcast,
        interviewing tech investors and entrepreneurs including Mark Cuban,
        Chris Sacca, Scott Galloway, and the founders of Figma, Headspace and
        Axios to name a few.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4">
        In 2021, my TikTok account (which started as a place to share clips from
        my podcast) was acquired by
        <a href="https://workweek.com" target="_blank" style="color: #0000EE" class="underline"
          >Workweek</a
        >.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4">
        That following year, I took on various freelance video creation projects
        for startups including
        <a href="https://levels.com" target="_blank" style="color: #0000EE" class="underline"
          >Levels Health</a
        >. This work ultimately served as the inspiration for what would become
        Montra.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4">
        We're building a video creation tool for software companies at Montra,
        and after spending the last decade tinkering with nearly every video
        editor under the sun, it's fitting that I'm finally building my own. You
        can check in on our progress
        <a href="https://montra.com" target="_blank" style="color: #0000EE" class="underline"
          >here</a
        >.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-6">
        I'm currently living in Brooklyn, New York, where I like to make videos,
        listen to podcasts and work out of coffee shops.
      </p>
